        <h2>A Mad Lib is an interactive story to which you add specific type of words when prompted.</h2>
          <br>
        <p> For example, an ADJECTIVE describes something or somebody.
          <br>
          Lumpy, soft, ugly, messy, and short are adjectives.</p>
          An ADVERB tells how something is done. It modifies a verb and usually ends in "ly".
          <br>
        <p> Modestly, stupidly, greedily, and carefully are adverbs.</p>
        <p> A NOUN is the name of a person, place, or thing.
          <br>
          Sidewalk, umbrella, toy, bathtub, and nose are nouns.
          <br>
          <p> A VERB is an action word. Run, pitch, jump, and swim are verbs.
          <br>
          Once all words are added, the story is ready. The end story is usually quite funny. Pick a song title below
          and insert your own words.
